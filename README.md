# 🗺️ Dynamic Route Planner using Dijkstra & A* Algorithms

This project is a **grid-based route planner** that finds the shortest path between two points using **Dijkstra's Algorithm** and **A* Search Algorithm**. It also provides a visual representation of the grid, obstacles, and computed path.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Implements both **Dijkstra** and **A\*** algorithms for pathfinding
- ✅ Visualizes grid, obstacles, and path using `matplotlib` and `networkx`
- ✅ Supports configurable grid size and dynamic obstacles
- ✅ Highlights performance difference between Dijkstra and A\*


## 🧠 Algorithms Used

- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Finds the shortest path by exploring all neighbors with the smallest cumulative cost.
- **A* Algorithm**: Improves efficiency by using a heuristic (Euclidean distance) to prioritize promising paths.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 3
- `heapq` for priority queue
- `networkx` for grid graph generation
- `matplotlib` for visualization
